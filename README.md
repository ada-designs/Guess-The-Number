Through a JavaScript course, I was able to take the tutorial-based "Guess the Number" game and significantly enhance it with new features and functionality. Here are some key improvements I implemented:

▶Streak System: Added a feature to track consecutive wins.
▶Highscore Feature: Implemented a highscore system based on the streak, encouraging replayability.
▶Streak Animation: Introduced animations to visually celebrate streak milestones.
▶Enhanced Game Logic: Improved difficulty scaling and refined the game logic for a better player experience.
▶Mobile Responsiveness: Adjusted the layout and functionality to work seamlessly on smaller screens.

Key skills I developed during this project include:

▶Designing and implementing complex game logic.
▶Utilizing if/else statements effectively for conditional behavior.
▶Mastering DOM manipulation to dynamically update and interact with the game elements.
▶Synchronizing functions for smooth gameplay and feature integration.
▶Applying principles of mobile responsiveness to create a user-friendly design on all devices.
▶This project not only helped me solidify my JavaScript knowledge but also deepened my understanding of creating interactive and engaging web applications.
